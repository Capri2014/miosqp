## TODO

-   [ ] Add functions: add_left and add_right for each node
    -   [ ] N.B. Update node l_i and u_i by restricting newly introduced ones in branching
-   [ ] Store solution when upper bound improves (only x, dual does not matter)
-   [ ] Add function to deal separately with root node
-   [ ] Add get_bounds function
